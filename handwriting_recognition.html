									Driven by a strong interest in handwriting recognition, I undertook the task of developing a number recognition system to convert handwritten numbers into accurate digital representations. This involved the meticulous process of coding and algorithmic exploration to ensure the reliability and precision of the system. </p>
							<p>I utilized real mouse-written datasets to explore the effectiveness of different approaches in mouse-writing recognition. While the MNIST dataset is commonly used for handwriting recognition, it primarily consists of handwritten digits rather than mouse-written characters. Hence, it has difficulties recognising mouse-written characters. To address this limitation, I incorporated real mouse-written data to provide a more diverse and representative dataset for my experiment. I employed two main methods, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Neural Networks, to analyze and compare their performance in recognizing mouse-written characters.</p>

								I conducted a comparison analysis to evaluate the performance of these methods. Additionally, I specifically examined their real-life accuracy, particularly when dealing with messy and challenging mouse-written samples.

								Only after testing their real-life accuracy, I realised that although KNN had a higher numerical accuracy of 88.97%, it had a much lower real-life accuracy than Neural Network, whose real life accuracy was around 95%, despite only having a numerical accuracy of 82.53%</p>
